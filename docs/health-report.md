# Codebase Health Report
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Scope:** Public Plugin → Custom Plugin Migration Readiness  
**Focus:** Quality, Maintainability, Correctness

---

## Executive Summary

The codebase is in **good health** with a clean Public ↔ Custom boundary. The handler pattern is consistent, the Custom adapter loader is safe, and the canonical Confluence pipeline is properly used. A few minor issues were identified and fixed.

**Overall Assessment:** ✅ **HEALTHY** - Ready for Custom Plugin migration

---

## ✅ What's Solid

### Architecture Consistency
- ✅ **Handler pattern is consistent** across assistants (Design Critique, Content Table)
- ✅ **Message routing is clear** in `main.ts` and `ui.tsx` with proper architecture headers
- ✅ **Canonical Confluence pipeline** (`buildConfluenceXhtmlFromTable`) is the only path to XHTML generation
- ✅ **Custom adapter loader** (`loadWorkAdapter`) safely handles missing override files with no-op fallback
- ✅ **Extension points** are properly documented and implemented

### Custom Adapter / Override Boundary
- ✅ **`.gitignore` covers all override files** (`src/work/*.override.ts`)
- ✅ **No custom-only constants/strings leak** into Public code
- ✅ **Override files use placeholders** (safe for Public repo)
- ✅ **Loader uses dynamic import** with proper error handling

### Content Table Contract
- ✅ **Validation/normalization** applied consistently (handler + Confluence export)
- ✅ **Schema invariants documented** in `EXTENSION_POINTS.md`
- ✅ **Ignore rules + DS detection + postProcess hooks** are optional and safe
- ✅ **Caching in scanner** prevents repeated detector calls (by node.id)

### Confluence Flow UX + Correctness
- ✅ **Modal flow matches spec**: Input → Processing (animated) → Success/Error
- ✅ **Public simulation behavior** is correct and isolated from Work API call
- ✅ **XHTML encoding applied once** via canonical pipeline (no double-encoding)
- ✅ **Spinner CSS class** is properly defined in `theme.css`

### Code Hygiene
- ✅ **No deprecated design system naming references** found (case-insensitive search)
- ✅ **Unused code removed** - `clipboard.ts` deleted (was not imported anywhere)
- ✅ **Documentation is up-to-date** (WORK_ADAPTER.md, EXTENSION_POINTS.md, AI_GUIDE.md)

## ⚠️ Risks / Tech Debt

### Minor Issues (Fixed)
1. **Debug endpoint in ui.tsx** - Hardcoded `DEBUG_LOG_ENDPOINT` should be removed or gated
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed - Removed debug endpoint and gated debug logging behind config flag

2. **Debug logging not gated** - `DEBUG_CLIPBOARD` flag is hardcoded to `true`
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed - Moved to CONFIG.dev flag

3. **Unused deprecated exports** - `clipboard.ts` exports deprecated functions that aren't used
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed - Deleted `clipboard.ts` entirely (file was not imported anywhere)

---

## 🐛 Bugs Found

**None** - No bugs identified during this health check.

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes (Prioritized)

### ✅ Completed Fixes

1. **Remove debug endpoint from ui.tsx**
   - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Risk:** Low
   - **Action:** Removed hardcoded `DEBUG_LOG_ENDPOINT` and moved debug logging behind `CONFIG.dev.enableClipboardDebugLogging` flag

2. **Gate debug logging behind config**
   - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Risk:** Low
   - **Action:** Added `CONFIG.dev.enableClipboardDebugLogging` flag and updated ui.tsx to respect it

3. **Remove unused deprecated exports**
   - **Priority:** Low
   - **Risk:** None
   - **Action:** Deleted `clipboard.ts` entirely (file was not imported anywhere, no backward compatibility needed)

### Future Improvements (Not Implemented - Low Priority)

2. **Add spinner component** to reduce duplication
   - **Priority:** Low
   - **Risk:** Low
   - **Note:** Spinner is currently defined in CSS and used inline (works fine)

---

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ `npm run build` passes
- ✅ No occurrences of deprecated design system naming remain (case-insensitive) - all replaced with "FPO-DS"
- ✅ Public plugin runs without custom overrides enabled
- ✅ All custom-only files are git-ignored
- ✅ No hardcoded endpoints in tracked files
- ✅ Canonical Confluence pipeline is the only XHTML path
- ✅ Handler pattern is consistent
- ✅ Extension points are properly documented

---

## Summary

The codebase is **healthy and ready** for Custom Plugin migration. All critical issues have been addressed:

- ✅ Clean Public ↔ Custom boundary
- ✅ Safe Custom adapter loader
- ✅ Consistent handler pattern
- ✅ Canonical Confluence pipeline
- ✅ Proper documentation
- ✅ No security leaks (endpoints, credentials)
- ✅ No deprecated design system naming references (all replaced with "FPO-DS")

**Migration Confidence:** ✅ **HIGH**
